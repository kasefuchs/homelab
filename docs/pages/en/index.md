# :material-home: Home

Hi! Welcome to the documentation of my homelab cluster called [Muttias](https://youtu.be/s1NddQPH1Wk).
Here you will find a lot of useful information on how to deploy and configure own homelab cluster.

I hope this project will help others to start building their own projects like this one!
